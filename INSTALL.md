# üì• How to Install

This page explains how you can install the SCP: Dystopia addon on your Minecraft Bedrock.

If you want it in development state without waiting for a proper release, read the [Build from source](#build-from-source).

## Installing a normal release

1. Download the addon file (name ends with `.mcaddon`)
1. Open the file, Minecraft should automatically install it for you.
1. Add the addon to your world and play!

## Build from source

‚ö†Ô∏è You can only do this on Windows or Linux.

### Installing the required tools

The required tools:
- Git
- pnpm
- Node.js

On Windows, open your terminal and run:
```bash
winget install Git.Git
winget install pnpm.pnpm
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

On Linux, I assume you can search it on your own.

Verify installation of each tool:
```bash
git --version
pnpm --version
node --version
```
