## Quick Summary

v2 alpha is discontinued. ([Details](#about-v2-alpha))

I'm restoring/recreating v1(.8) from scratch.

Then, I'll re-add "new" features from v2 alpha.

I plan to release early access versions more frequently than before.

When all of that is done, v2 is complete.

## Goal

**The goal is to recreate the state where the SCP: Dystopia addon was working fine.** üõ†Ô∏è

To achieve that, I learned that I have to *pause* development of new features,
and focus on restoration part first.

I decided that it would be too difficult to carry out this restoration work
with so many incomplete new features, therefore I'm doing it from ground up. üí™

## Why restore v1

For those who don't know: SCP: Dystopia used to be a relatively big addon with many features.
**But the core parts of it has been destroyed by Minecraft updates.**

And I want to recreate the once-worked SCP: Dystopia.

## Why I struggled in the past

You might already know that I said similar things before and I couldn't do it for once. üòÖ

That was because I didn't really focus on restoring v1,
and I leaned too much into adding and maintaining new features (that aren't even complete).
Which definitely stagnated the project.

But this time, by deferring the development of new features, I'm able to focus
on restoration.

Think of it like a house: a solid, cleanly restored v1 is the foundation,
and the new features are built on top of that.

I'm taking it easy btw. üòå

## Early accesses

I plan to release early access versions more frequently than before. üçÉ

Each early access version will be less important and more experimental.
So, **you shouldn't use it in a serious project**.

## About v2 alpha

*Maintenance cost of incomplete new features has stagnated the project...*

The "v2 alpha", which was underway from February 2024 to August 2025, **is discontinued**.
So, [2.0.0 Alpha 5](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha-5)
will be the last "v2 alpha" version.

I will be careful to never lose focus on restoration this time.

But don't worry, I will bring back popular ideas like Lockdown System and CCTV once the restoration part is done.
