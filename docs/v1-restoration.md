## üìå The Goal

**The goal is to recreate the state where the SCP: Dystopia addon was working
fine before destructive Minecraft updates.**

To achieve that, I learned that I have to *pause* development of new features,
and focus on restoration part first.

I decided that it would be too difficult to carry out this restoration work
with so many incomplete new features. Therefore, I'm doing it from scratch.

## ‚ùì Why

For those who don't know: SCP: Dystopia used to be a relatively big addon with many features.
**But the core parts of the addon has been destroyed by recent Minecraft updates.**
